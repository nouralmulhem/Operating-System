# Operating-System
it is a simulator to show the function of the scheduler of the operating system 

it schedules with many different algorithms:
- First come first served (FCFS)
- Shortest remaining time next (SRTN)
- Round Robin (RR)

<br/>

keeping in mind the memory capacity, it basicly do two level scheduling (short term and long term).
